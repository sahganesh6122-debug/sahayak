# 🏥 Sahayak
## AI-Assisted Patient Clinical History Platform

**Smart India Hackathon 2026 | Problem Statement SIH26047**  
**Ministry of Ayush | All India Institute of Ayurveda**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

High-patient-load OPDs at AIIA and similar institutions face significant challenges:
- Doctors spend 30–40% of consultation time on history-taking
- Paper records are difficult to structure and search  
- Patient-reported history is often incomplete or poorly documented
- Limited time for each patient in high-load settings

## 💡 Solution Overview

Sahayak is an **AI-assisted, assistive** clinical information and documentation system that:
- Guides patients through structured history-taking before they see the doctor
- Uses rule-based adaptive questioning for relevant follow-up
- Detects potential red-flag symptoms for triage signaling
- Generates AI-assisted structured summaries for doctor review
- Provides doctors with a complete, organized patient case ready for review

> **⚕️ Medical Safety Notice**: Sahayak is a clinical documentation assistant. It does NOT provide diagnoses, prescribe medications, or replace qualified medical professionals. All AI-generated content requires doctor review and confirmation.
